The game of Fives.

For more info, see (https://www.kith.org/words/1997/06/01/v-five/).

Implemented by Jed Hartman, 3/2022. For license info, see below.


The core idea of the game:

The computer picks a five-letter English word with no repeating letters.

The player tries to figure out what that word is, by guessing five-letter
English words with no repeating letters.

After each player guess, the computer shows which positions in the answer
contain letters that are in the guess.

For example, if the program’s chosen answer is the word `chaos`, and the player
guesses `dough`, the program displays `dough` for the second and fourth
positions, because the second and fourth letters in `chaos` (H and O) appear in
`dough`.

TODOs:

TODO: Translate into JS.

TODO: Maybe indicate which letters are definitely not in the word? (All the
letters in all the “no match” guesses.)

Optional TODO: Let user specify a letter, or a group of letters, for each
position? Not sure what the text interface for this would be. Think about it.
Maybe a free-form text field that they can type anything into?

TODO: Handle /quit better. (Just saying the answer is correct is a kludge.)

TODO: Detect and handle error in case of control character or "[" in guess.

TODO: Read all words from files instead of hardcoded?

TODO: At launch, auto-validate every word on the full list (as being five
lowercase English letters with no repeats), to make sure nothing invalid sneaks
in?
